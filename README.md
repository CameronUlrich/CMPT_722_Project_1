# CMPT_722_Project_1

PLEASE DISREGARD MSCS722_Project_1 AND test. I was having difficulty upload and committing files before.

RUN THE GAME BY RUNNING THE MainActivity FILE IN CMPT_722_Project_1/app/src/main/java/com/example/project1_game/MainActivity.java

Tap the left of the screen to fly up and the right of the screen to shoot. If a bird hits the pig or gets to the left end of the screen the game is over.
